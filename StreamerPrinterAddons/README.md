# Streamer Printer Add-ons

The following directories contain various add-ons for [DJ Teo's](https://www.twitch.tv/dj_teo) [Streamerbot Sub Printer package](https://ko-fi.com/s/37c18da75d), which you can download (and while not required, you 100% SHOULD PURCHASE) here: https://ko-fi.com/s/37c18da75d

This assumes you even own a thermal printer, which I do not. They were created specifically for [KatLink](https://www.twitch.tv/katlink) who streams lots of indie horror games, speedruns, and more late into the night, and you should go follow her here: https://www.twitch.tv/katlink

## Add-on Installation
1. Locate your Streamer.bot directory on your PC.
2. Open the `teotools \ streamerprinter \ addons` folder inside of it.
3. Open `addons.js` inside of the local addons folder from step 2 with a text editor of your choice ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) are excellent).
4. At the end of the local file add the contents of the `addons.js` file found here in the repo.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but now for `addons.html`
6. Click the `StreamerBotAction.cfb` file found here in the repo and click the "Copy raw file" button
7. Inside of Streamer.bot, click the "Import" button at the top and paste in what you just copied in step 6, then hit the Import button at the bottom.
8. Set the triggers for your new Action inside Streamer.bot which assumes whoever reads this already knows how to do
