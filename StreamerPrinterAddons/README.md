# Streamer Printer Add-ons

The following directories contain various add-ons for [DJ Teo's](https://www.twitch.tv/dj_teo) [Streamerbot Sub Printer package](https://ko-fi.com/s/37c18da75d), which you can download (and while not required, you 100% SHOULD PURCHASE FROM HIM) here: https://ko-fi.com/s/37c18da75d

This assumes you even own a thermal printer, which I do not. They were created specifically for [KatLink](https://www.twitch.tv/katlink) who streams lots of indie horror games, speedruns, and more late into the night, and you should go follow her here: https://www.twitch.tv/katlink

## Add-on Installation
1. Click the `StreamerBotAction.cfb` file found here in the repo, then click the `Copy raw file` button.
2. Inside of Streamer.bot, click the `Import` button at the top and paste in what you just copied in step 6, then hit the `Import` button at the bottom.
3. Set the event triggers for your new Action inside Streamer.bot which assumes whoever reads this already knows how to do.
4. Check for any add-on specific Sub-Actions that may need custom values (webhook Urls, etc).

## Discord Webhook Instructions
If the Add-on has the option of sending data to a Discord Webhook Url, you can set one up by:
1. Creating or choosing an existing Discord channel for your notifications.
2. Click the gear to `Edit Channel` by hovering over the channel in the list.
3. Navigate to the `Integrations` menu, then `Webhooks`.
4. Click the `New Webhook` button, then click on the newly listed webhook.
5. The `Copy Webhook URL` button should likely be all you need to paste into a Streamer.bot Sub-Action when noted.
